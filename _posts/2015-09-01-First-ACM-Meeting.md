Hello ACM Members!

We're officially kicking off the University of Arizona ACM for the 2015-2016 school year! Our first
meeting will be on the 10th of September in Gould-Simpson Rm. 942 at 7:00PM. The first meeting will
serve as an official introduction to the club. Additionally, we're going to have some of our fellow
ACM members discussing the internships that they took part in during the 2015 summer. If you would
like to talk about your internship during the meeting, feel free to send an email to [the ACM
officers](mailto:acmofficers@cs.arizona.edu)!
