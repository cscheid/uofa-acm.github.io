[Make a LISP](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) is a project on github that walks you through a implementation of a LISP dialect based on Clojure. Currently, the spec has been implemented in 27 different languages, including interesting implementations in [bash](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/bash) and [GNU make](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/make).

This talk will serve as a high level introduction to the project.
