Hello, my name is Eric and I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in ISTA
(Information Science, Technology, and Arts). Areas that I'm interested in include computer
networking and high performance computing. Currently, I work as an undergraduate research
assistant on the [Named Data Networking](http://named-data.net) project in the
[Network Research Laboratory](http://nrl.cs.arizona.edu).
