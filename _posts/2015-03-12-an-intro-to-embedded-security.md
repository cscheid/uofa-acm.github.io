Now that processors have become cheap and efficient, everything from your car to your credit card has become integrated with "smart" technologies, essentially meaning that they have become small computers. However, along with the benefits and capabilities of these new platforms come increased security risks. This talk will provide a brief overview of some of these risks, and demonstrate how to detect, exploit, then mitigate them. As with any talk of this nature, the subjects of illegal access and "hacking" will be covered. However, the University of Arizona ACM chapter condones such actions, and they are discussed purely for academic and preventative reasons.
