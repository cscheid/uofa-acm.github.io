While IRC seems like a somewhat dated form of communication, it is still
prevalent in software development communities.  There are active IRC channels
for:

* Programming Languages
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/community/irc/)
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/community/)
    * [Haskell](http://new-www.haskell.org/irc)
* Open Source Projects
    * [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)
    * [Ubuntu](http://community.ubuntu.com/contribute/support/irc/)
* [Internal Corporate Communication](http://www.quora.com/Which-companies-make-use-of-IRC-internally#)

The communities that form in IRC channels are often quite helpful,
and are generally interested in discussing a project you might be working on,
or a bug you are stuck on.

Part of IRC's appeal is the fact that it's an open protocol.  This means
companies or individuals can write bots to perform non-trivial tasks, and
interact with these bots via IRC, where the rest of their team can be aware
of what is going on.

To this end, I have been working on an IRC Bot template called
[BotPlate](https://github.com/mgaut72/BotPlate).  BotPlate contains a core
class to handle IRC connection and communication, and is easily extensible to
add any new functionality.
